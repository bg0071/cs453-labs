# Lab 2 - Hello HTTP + JSON

In Lab 1, you worked directly with a TCP socket and created a small command-based server.

In this lab, you will move up one layer and build a small HTTP JSON service. Instead of inventing your own command format, you will use HTTP methods, paths, status codes, headers, and JSON request/response bodies.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this lab, you should be able to:

* Explain the difference between a raw TCP message and an HTTP request.
* Create a basic HTTP server in Node.js.
* Read the HTTP method and request path.
* Parse a JSON request body.
* Return JSON responses.
* Use appropriate HTTP status codes.
* Handle invalid or unexpected client input without crashing the server.
* Test HTTP request-handling behavior.

## Starter Code Structure

The starter code is located in:

```text
labs/lab02-http-json/starter/
```

The starter project has this structure:

```text
starter/
├── package.json
├── src/
│   └── server.js
└── test/
    └── server.test.js
```

### File Descriptions

| File                  | Purpose                                                    |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/server.js`       | Starts the HTTP server and handles incoming HTTP requests. |
| `test/server.test.js` | Contains automated tests for the HTTP JSON service.        |
| `package.json`        | Defines project metadata, dependencies, and npm scripts.   |

## Required Features

Your HTTP server must support the following routes.

### `GET /health`

Returns a JSON response showing that the server is running.

Example response:

```json
{
  "status": "ok"
}
```

### `POST /echo`

Accepts a JSON request body and returns the same data back to the client.

Example request body:

```json
{
  "message": "hello"
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "message": "hello"
}
```

### `POST /calculate`

Accepts a JSON request body with an operation and two numbers.

Example request body:

```json
{
  "operation": "add",
  "a": 2,
  "b": 3
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "result": 5
}
```

Your server must support at least the following operations:

| Operation  | Meaning               |
| ---------- | --------------------- |
| `add`      | Add `a` and `b`       |
| `subtract` | Subtract `b` from `a` |
| `multiply` | Multiply `a` and `b`  |
| `divide`   | Divide `a` by `b`     |

The server should return an error response for unsupported operations.

### `GET /requests`

Returns information about how many requests the server has handled since it started.

Example response:

```json
{
  "count": 4
}
```

## Error Handling

Your server should not crash when it receives bad input.

At minimum, your server should handle:

* Unknown routes.
* Unsupported HTTP methods.
* Invalid JSON.
* Missing required fields.
* Unsupported calculation operations.
* Division by zero.

Use reasonable HTTP status codes such as:

| Status Code | Meaning               |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| `200`       | OK                    |
| `400`       | Bad request           |
| `404`       | Not found             |
| `405`       | Method not allowed    |
| `500`       | Internal server error |

Error responses should be returned as JSON.

Example error response:

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid JSON"
}
```

## Running the Lab

First, move into the starter directory:

```bash
cd labs/lab02-http-json/starter
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the server:

```bash
npm run server
```

By default, the server should listen on port `3000`.

You can test the server in a browser by visiting:

```text
http://localhost:3000/health
```

You can also test it with `curl`.

Example:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

Example `POST /echo` request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/echo \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":"hello"}'
```

Example `POST /calculate` request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/calculate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"operation":"add","a":2,"b":3}'
```

## Configuring the Port

The server should use port `3000` by default.

You can run the server on a different port by setting the `PORT` environment variable:

```bash
PORT=4000 npm run server
```

Then send requests to the new port:

```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/health
```

## Testing

This lab includes automated tests for the HTTP JSON service.

Run the tests from the starter directory:

```bash
npm test
```

Some tests may fail when you first receive the starter code. Your job is to update the implementation until the required tests pass.

The tests should check behavior such as:

* `GET /health` returns a JSON status response.
* `POST /echo` returns the submitted JSON data.
* `POST /calculate` performs supported calculations.
* Unknown routes return an error.
* Invalid JSON returns an error.
* The server does not crash on bad input.

You may also run the tests in watch mode if supported by the starter project:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

## Suggested Workflow

1. Run the server before changing anything.
2. Try `GET /health` manually in a browser or with `curl`.
3. Run the automated tests.
4. Open `src/server.js`.
5. Implement one route at a time.
6. Run `npm test` after each change.
7. Test manually with `curl`.
8. Update this README if your final behavior differs from the examples.

## Reflection Questions

Answer the following questions in your submission:

1. What is the difference between a TCP message and an HTTP request?
A: A TCP message is just raw data sent over a TCP connection. The programmer has to decide what the message format means. An HTTP request is structured data sent over TCP using a standard format. It includes a method such as GET or POST, a path such as /health, headers such as Content-Type, and sometimes a body such as JSON data.
2. What does the `Content-Type: application/json` header tell the server?
A: The Content-Type: application/json header tells the server that the request body is formatted as JSON. This lets the server know that it should parse the body using JSON.parse instead of treating it as plain text or some other format.
3. Why should a server return different HTTP status codes for different situations?
A: Different status codes help the client understand what happened. A 200 status means the request worked. A 400 status means the client sent bad input. A 404 status means the route was not found. A 405 status means the route exists, but the HTTP method was not allowed. These codes make the API easier to test, debug, and use correctly.
4. What happens if the client sends invalid JSON?
A: If the client sends invalid JSON, the server catches the JSON parsing error and returns a 400 Bad Request response with a JSON error message. The server should not crash because of invalid client input.
5. How is this lab different from Lab 1?
A: Lab 1 used raw TCP sockets and a custom command format. In this lab, the server uses HTTP, which provides standard methods, paths, headers, status codes, and JSON request and response bodies. This lab is closer to how real web APIs are usually built.

## Graduate Students

Graduate students should complete one additional feature.

Choose one of the following:

1. Add a new route, such as `GET /time` or `POST /uppercase`.
2. Add one additional calculation operation and document it.
3. Improve the request counter so it tracks counts by route.
4. Add additional automated tests for error handling.

Document your graduate extension in your submission.
